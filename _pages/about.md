I am a Senior Undergraduate in the Department of Electrical Engineering, pursuing a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar. I am extremely interested in the interdisciplinary domain of Computer Architecture and Machine Learning. I am passionate about designing highly energy-efficient hardware for emerging applications like ML and AI. I have been working mainly on projects involving real-world applications of Machine Learning as well as devising optimized hardware to carry out such computationally heavy tasks.
