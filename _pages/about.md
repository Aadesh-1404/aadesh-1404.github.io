### Applying for MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering/Electrical Engineering (Fall '23)

I am a Senior Undergraduate in the Department of Electrical Engineering, pursuing a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar. I find the research areas that deal with building solutions for real-world applications using technology, quite intriguing. I have been working mainly on projects involving real-world applications of Machine Learning and Computer Vision as well as devising optimized hardware to carry out such computationally heavy tasks. Iâ€™m always passionate to learn and explore cross-discipline research topics.


**Interest Topics**: Applied Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Bayesian Modeling, Reinforcement Learning, Digital Systems and Architecture.
